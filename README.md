*ASSIGNMENT I (due before Xmas holidays):

Using CLIPS, create your own knowledge-base system for a problem of
your choice where rule-based knowledge represenation is suitable.
It has to support reasoning under uncertainty using a formal methodology.

That is to say, you have to:
1) decide how you are going to implement the uncertainty methodology
into CLIPS
2) taking into account the above design decision, create a CLIPS rule
base to represent your problem's knowledge base and experiment
by consult it into CLIPS in order to ensure that it properly functions

Your assignment should include:
- Description of the implementation of the uncertainty manipulation
in your system
- Your problem's description and some example runs
- Your CLIPS code with comments, if required


The CLIPS code and documentation is downloadable from:
http://www.clipsrules.net/
Recommended version for downloading is: CLIPS 6.3
Recommended documentation to consult is:
- Userâ€™s Guide: smooth introduction of CLIPS
- Basic Programming Guide: for a reference when detailed information
for a CLIPS contruct or command is needed
Of less use for your assignment is: Advanced Programming Guide
The Interfaces Guide won't be needed probably at all.
