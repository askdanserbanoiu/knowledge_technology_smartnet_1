# ASSIGNMENT I 

Using CLIPS, create a knowledge-base system for a problem of choice where rule-based knowledge represenation is suitable. It has to support reasoning under uncertainty using a formal methodology:

1) decide how to implement the uncertainty methodology into CLIPS
2) create a CLIPS rule base to represent the problem's knowledge base and experiment by consult it into CLIPS in order to ensure that it properly functions

To be included:
- Description of the implementation of the uncertainty manipulation
in your system
- Your problem's description and some example runs
- Your CLIPS code with comments, if required


The CLIPS code and documentation is downloadable from http://www.clipsrules.net/.
Recommended version for downloading is CLIPS 6.3 and the documentation to consult is mostly:
- Userâ€™s Guide: smooth introduction of CLIPS
- Basic Programming Guide: for a reference when detailed information
