# ASSIGNMENT I 

Using CLIPS 6.3, create a knowledge-base system with support to reasoning under uncertainty. After choosing a suitable problem, decide how to implement the uncertainty methodology into CLIPS and create a CLIPS rule base to represent the problem's knowledge base and experiment by consult it to ensure that it properly functions.

To be included:
- Description of the implementation of the uncertainty manipulation in your system
- Problem's description and some example runs
- CLIPS code with comments

The CLIPS code and documentation is downloadable from http://www.clipsrules.net/. The documentation to consult is mostly:
- Userâ€™s Guide: smooth introduction of CLIPS
- Basic Programming Guide: for a reference when detailed information
- https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sylee/courses/clips/bpg/top.html
