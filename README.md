# JOBEX

I implemented an intelligent system that acts as a career advisor. For every user it produces a set of jobs that are best suited for him/her, based on the answers he/she will give to a questionnaire.
Every answer generates 1 or more facts. Every fact has an associated numeric value between -1 and 1 called certainty factor (CF). Through a repeated application of modus ponens the system infers the best set of jobs, also with an associated certainty factor (CF). 

The CLIPS code and documentation is downloadable from http://www.clipsrules.net/. The documentation to consult is mostly:
- Userâ€™s Guide: smooth introduction of CLIPS
- Basic Programming Guide: for a reference when detailed information
- https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~sylee/courses/clips/bpg/top.html

To test the program load jobex.clp into CLIPS, reset and run.
